# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is my first fully functional Python application.

**Features**
The game features a Tic Tac Toe board with up to nine blocks. It was built utilizing core Python concepts including **classes, loops, functions, and arrays** to create a more complex project than the usual implementation. The major purpose of this project was to learn and practice Python using my Java skills and experience.

**Key Functionalities:**
  - Win Check: Ensures the game correctly identifies a win condition when a player has filled a column, row, diagonal, or anti-diagonal with their symbol.
  - Draw Check: Determines if the game has ended in a draw when all cells are filled without any player winning.
  - User Input Translation: Converts user input into board coordinates for game moves.
