# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is my first Python project that I build the whole app.  

The game features a Tic Tac Toe board with up to nine blocks. It was built utilizing core Python concepts with the goal of creating a more complex project than the usual implementation. 
The major purpose of this project was to learn and practice Python syntaxÂ using my Java skills and experience.
